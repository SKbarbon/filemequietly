## Why ðŸ™‚??
Okay, I don't have to play subway-surface in the background while explaining this right? XD

You have a file on your computer that you want to share it with a bunch of people. But maybe this file have content that is againest your usual file sharing third-party service rules? Or maybe you just don't want to put such file in a service's cloud? Maybe this file exeeds the free size limit and the service wants you to pay to share now? IDC!

It's simple, FileMeQuietly will allow you to share your file directly with the people you want. No Censorship, No party in the middle and no size limit.

## Bruh, how the F does that work? XD
Will To achieve this "free-of-cost and no third-party involved in the middle" experience, I did follow this approach:

Your file is in your computer, the tool will start a local-host to host the file. But wait, how people on other network will access this host? We need someway to mirror a global URL to your locahost right?. So I used Ngrok APIs for this, and as you know it's totally free.

I am just a boy with an idea ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆðŸŽ€.
